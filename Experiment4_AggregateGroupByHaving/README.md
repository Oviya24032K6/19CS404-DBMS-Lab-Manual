# Experiment 4: Aggregate Functions, Group By and Having Clause
### Ren No : 212223110033
### Name : OVIYA P
## AIM
To study and implement aggregate functions, GROUP BY, and HAVING clause with suitable examples.

## THEORY

### Aggregate Functions
These perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

- **MIN()** – Smallest value  
- **MAX()** – Largest value  
- **COUNT()** – Number of rows  
- **SUM()** – Total of values  
- **AVG()** – Average of values

**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT AGG_FUNC(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### GROUP BY
Groups records with the same values in specified columns.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;
```
### HAVING
Filters the grouped records based on aggregate conditions.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING condition;
```

**Question 1**
```

```
For example:
Result
Medication     AvgDosage
-------------  ----------
Ciprofloxacin  500.0
Doxorubicin    60.0
Ibuprofen      400.0
Levothyroxine  50.0
Lisinopril     10.0
MMR            0.5
Pending        0.0
Prenatal vita  1.0
Sertraline     50.0
Topiramate     25.0
```

```sql
select Medication,avg(Dosage) as AvgDosage
from Prescriptions
group by Medication;
```

**Output:**
